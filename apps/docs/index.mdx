---

`better-cmdk` is a React command palette with built-in AI chat.

Use it in three modes:

1. Command palette only (`actions`, no chat).
2. Command palette + hosted chat (default, no setup).
3. Command palette + external agent (`chat`, recommended with [modifywithai](https://modifywithai.com)).

Hosted chat uses `https://better-cmdk.com/api/chat` by default as a developer trial service (free, no signup, rate-limited to 10 requests per 10 minutes). For production, set your own `chatEndpoint` or use [modifywithai](https://modifywithai.com) for agentic capabilities.

## Core model: one actions array

Define one `CommandAction[]` list and reuse it everywhere.

- `better-cmdk` uses UI fields (`label`, `group`, `icon`, `shortcut`, `keywords`) for search and rendering.
- `modifywithai` uses agent fields (`description`, `inputSchema`, `approvalRequired`, `execute`) for action execution.
- If a library does not use a field, it ignores it.

```tsx
import { CommandMenu, type CommandAction } from "better-cmdk";
import { SettingsIcon } from "lucide-react";

const actions: CommandAction[] = [
  {
    name: "open-settings",
    label: "Open Settings",
    description: "Navigate to the settings page",
    group: "Navigation",
    icon: <SettingsIcon className="size-4" />,
    shortcut: "⌘,",
    execute: () => router.push("/settings"),
  },
  {
    name: "navigate-to",
    label: "Navigate to page",
    description: "Navigate to a specific route in the app",
    inputSchema: {
      path: { type: "string", description: "Destination path", required: true },
    },
    execute: ({ path }) => router.push(String(path)),
  },
];

<CommandMenu open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen} actions={actions} />;
```

## Action types

| Type | Definition | Behavior |
|------|------------|----------|
| Command-like | No `inputSchema` | Runs directly from search/select |
| Argument-requiring | Has `inputSchema` | Routed through AI so arguments can be provided |

Keep one entry per operation. Do not duplicate the same operation as separate "command" and "AI action" entries.

## Integration options

| Option | Use when | CommandMenu props |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| No chat | You want search + shortcuts only | `actions` |
| Hosted chat (default) | You want to quickly try AI chat during development | `actions` |
| External agent | You want agentic action execution and approvals | `actions`, `chat` |
