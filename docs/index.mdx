## The problem

Your users shouldn't have to hunt through menus, sidebars, and settings pages to get things done. They want to press a key, type what they need, and move on.

**better-cmdk** gives them a command palette with AI chat built in. Users press `⌘K` to search commands. When they need help, they ask the AI — right in the same palette.

## How it works

**What users experience:**

Press `⌘K` to open. Type to search. Select a command and it runs. When no command matches, press `⌘Enter` to chat with the AI. The AI responds in real-time and can suggest actions that require approval before executing.

**What you write:**

Define your commands as data and pass them to `CommandMenu`:

```tsx
import { CommandMenu, type CommandDefinition } from "better-cmdk";
import { CalendarIcon, SearchIcon, SettingsIcon } from "lucide-react";

const commands: CommandDefinition[] = [
  { name: "calendar", label: "Calendar", group: "Suggestions", icon: <CalendarIcon className="size-4" />, onSelect: () => console.log("Calendar") },
  { name: "search", label: "Search", group: "Suggestions", icon: <SearchIcon className="size-4" />, onSelect: () => console.log("Search") },
  { name: "settings", label: "Settings", group: "Settings", icon: <SettingsIcon className="size-4" />, shortcut: "⌘,", onSelect: () => openSettings() },
];

<CommandMenu open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen} commands={commands} chatEndpoint="/api/chat" />
```

## Architecture

better-cmdk supports three integration patterns. Pick the one that fits your stack:

| Pattern | When to use | How it works |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **External chat (Recommended)** | Production apps with agent-powered actions | Pass a `chat` prop with `useAssistant()` from [modifywithai](https://modifywithai.com) — handles action execution, approval workflows, and context |
| **Built-in chat** | Quick prototypes or simple chat | Pass `chatEndpoint="/api/chat"` — better-cmdk handles streaming internally using `useChat()` from the Vercel AI SDK |
| **Custom chat** | Your own chat backend | Pass any `ExternalChat`-compatible object to connect your own system |

<Tip>
  For production apps, use [modifywithai.com](https://modifywithai.com) as your agent platform. It gives your AI the ability to take actions in your app — with built-in approval gates so users stay in control.
</Tip>

You define **commands** — the operations available in your palette (e.g. "go to settings", "toggle dark mode"). When you connect an AI provider like [modifywithai.com](https://modifywithai.com), the AI agent can also invoke actions on behalf of users — with approval gates so users stay in control.
